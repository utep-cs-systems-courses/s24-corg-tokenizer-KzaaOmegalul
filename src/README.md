Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

This directory contains source code for a program dubbed
"Tokenizer". Tokenizer reads user inputting strings and tokenizes them by
word with a final zero-terminator token, and prints them out. Additionally, it
creates a history of inputed strings and tokens, which can have information
pulled from.

For example
```
./tokenizer

> Hello World String
Token[0]: Hello
Token[1]: World
Token[2]: String
Token[3]: 0
```
