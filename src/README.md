Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
This directory contains source code for a program dubbed
"Tokenizer". Tokenizer reads user inputting strings and tokenizes them by
word with a final zero-terminator token, and prints them out. Additionally, it
creates a history of inputed strings and tokens, which can have information
pulled from.

For example
```
./tokenizer

> Hello World String
Token[0]: Hello
Token[1]: World
Token[2]: String
Token[3]: 0
```
